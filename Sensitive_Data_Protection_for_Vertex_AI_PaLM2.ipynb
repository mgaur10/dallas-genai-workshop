    "### Protecting Gen AI Applications from Data Leakage\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive datasets of text. LLMs can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When incorporating your own data into generative AI applications especially via [Model Tuning](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/tune-models) it's possible to return a prediction with data from your dataset. In this case many organizations may want to filter LLM responses for sensitive data.\n",

    "[Sensitive Data Protection(Cloud DLP)](https://cloud.google.com/dlp) is a fully managed service designed to discover, classify, and protect your sensitive data, where it resides from databases, text-based content, or even images. It uses a variety of methods to identify sensitive data, including regular expressions, dictionaries, and contextual elements. Once sensitive data is identified, Sensitive Data Protection(Cloud DLP) can take several actions to either classify it, mask it, encrypt it or even delete it.\n",

    "Sensitive Data Protection(Cloud DLP) can be accessed via Cloud Console and used to scan data within Cloud Storage, BigQuery and other Google Cloud services.

    "Large language models (LLMs) can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems. At the same time, as an early-stage technology, its evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and unintended or unforeseen consequences. Large language models can generate output that you don't expect, including text that's offensive, insensitive, or factually incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, the incredible versatility of LLMs is also what makes it difficult to predict exactly what kinds of unintended or unforeseen outputs they might produce. Given these risks and complexities, the PaLM API is designed with [Google's AI Principles](https://ai.google/principles/) in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy safely and responsibly. To aid developers, the Generative AI Studio has built-in content filtering, and the PaLM API has safety attribute scoring to help customers test Google's safety filters and define confidence thresholds that are right for their use case and business. Please refer to the [Safety filters and attributes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#safety_filters_and_attributes) section to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the PaLM API is integrated into a customer's unique use case and context, additional responsible AI considerations and [PaLM limitations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#palm_limitations) may need to be considered. We encourage customers to leverage fairness, interpretability, privacy and security [recommended practices](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/)."
